# Mockup-to-Article
## Project Instructions
Review the Article to Mockup Project Rubric.

1. Download and unzip `mockup-to-article.zip` in the Supporting Materials section, below. You'll find `index.html`, the article mockup image (`blog-mockup.pdf`) and a file called reflections.txt inside.

2. Use what you've learned about web development so far to edit `index.html` so that it looks <strong>exactly</strong> like the mockup image. You will need to use new elements, which means that you'll need to [research](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) and experiment! (Hint: look up "superscript," "horizontal rule," and "strikethrough."). Note: You can recreate the mockup without using a single `<br>` tag! You don't need to worry about line breaks. The text should naturally wrap depending on how wide the window is.

3. When you've finished building the article, open up `reflections.txt`. You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development in `reflections.txt`. Answer the following questions:
- What new skills have you learned?
- What has been easy?
- What has been difficult?
- How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
